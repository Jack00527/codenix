# Add Achievements Section to About Page

## Overview

Add a scalable "Achievements" section showcasing club accomplishments, starting with Team Terabyte's Smart India Hackathon 2024 victory.

## Implementation Steps

### 1. Copy the Image to Public Assets

- Move the image from `c:\Users\subhg\Downloads\drive-download-20251021T155627Z-1-001\` to the project's public directory
- Name it appropriately (e.g., `sih-2024-winner.jpg` or similar)
- Ensure it's optimized for web use

### 2. Add Achievement Data Structure

In `app/about/page.tsx` (around line 70, after activities array):

```typescript
const achievements = [
  {
    title: "SIH Winner 2024",
    date: "11-12 December 2024",
    description: "GCU celebrated the achievement of Team Terabyte, winners of the 1st Prize at the Smart India Hackathon 2024, held at Welingkar Institute of Management, Mumbai. The team secured a cash prize of ₹1 lakh and received a warm felicitation from the GCU community in the presence of the Hon'ble Vice Chancellor, Registrar, Deans, and HoDs.",
    details: "Their mentor, Mr. Adarsh Pradhan, Assistant Professor, CSE Department, emphasized the value of perseverance and learning from failure. Team members shared their experiences and thanked the university for its support. Recognizing their achievement, the Vice Chancellor announced an additional reward of ₹1.5 lakh for the team and their mentor, calling it a proud milestone for GCU and urging everyone to continue motivating students toward excellence.",
    image: "/sih-2024-winner.jpg",
    prize: "₹2.5 lakh total",
  }
]
```

### 3. Create Achievements Section UI

Insert new section after the "What We Do" section (after line 136) and before "Meet Our Committee" heading:

- Add "Our Achievements" heading with gradient styling consistent with page design
- Create achievement cards with:
  - Image on the left (responsive layout)
  - Content on the right including title, date, description, and details
  - Hover effects matching existing card styles
  - Same glassmorphic design pattern as other sections
- Use Next.js Image component for optimization

### 4. Import Image Component

Add `Image` to imports from `next/image` at the top of the file

## Design Considerations

- Match existing card styling (glassmorphic background, gold border)
- Ensure responsive layout (stack image/content on mobile)
- Use grid/flex layout for future scalability
- Maintain consistent spacing and typography with the rest of the page
