    content: `Smart India Hackathon, or SIH, is the largest national-level hackathon organized by the Government of India, with participation from nearly every college across the nation each year. Contrary to what many non-technical people might assume, the word 'hackathon' doesn't imply hacking as portrayed in sci-fi movies with cryptic codes on flashing screens. Instead, the essence of SIH lies in promoting innovation, can be software or hardware, aiming to create impactful solutions.

In brief, SIH is a competition where some major organizations from all over India provide real-world problem statements, challenging the youth (college students) to develop practical solutions and present prototypes for potential implementation.

Our team, Terabyte, representing Girijananda Chowdhury University, not only participated in the prestigious competition last year but also proudly emerged as one of the winners.

In the 2024 Smart India Hackathon, over 4.9 lakh college students registered, with 50,000 teams nominated by Higher Education Institutes (HEIs), each team comprising up to six members. Each problem statement in SIH can have only one winner. The competition featured 254 problem statements (186 software-based and 68 hardware-based), with five finalists selected for the grand finale from each problem statement.

Among the numerous challenges presented, our team chose a problem statement by Bharat Electronics Limited (BEL): developing an offline AI image recognition chatbot software. This challenge attracted over 400 submissions, and our team secured a spot among the top five finalists. Once shortlisted, teams must travel to a nodal center, which could be located anywhere in India. For us, that destination was Welingkar Institute of Management, Mumbai.

Our team, comprising six first-semester students and guided by our mentor, competed against four other teams tackling the same problem statement. Among them were strong contenders from well-known institutes like IIT Kharagpur, making the challenge even more intense. Along the way, we also interacted with other teams working on different problem statements, including those developing prototypes for esteemed organizations like the NSG.

BEL, being part of the Ministry of Defense, had specific requirements for the software: the software must operate offline, be capable of training with custom datasets, and have a fully interactive user interface. We not only met their expectations but also introduced additional features that left a positive impression on the judges. As the team leader, I documented every step of the process—from crafting presentations and developing prototypes to outlining the roadmap. Looking ahead, I aim to mentor future participants from our college, sharing insights and guiding them toward success.

Winning the hackathon as first-semester students was an incredible experience, and people often ask how we managed it. Honestly, I had a bit of background in programming and software development, having worked on some commercial projects before, which gave me confidence in developing a prototype.

Although my team members were new to coding, I advised them on what to learn and implement, assigning tasks based on their strengths. For example, Sankhyarick Swami, a web enthusiast from our team, handled the website development for our software, while Rishav Kumar Singh, with his C++ experience and some knowledge of AI, researched about the model and training part. Our mentor, Adarsh Pradhan, was a pillar of support throughout the process. With his prior expertise in AI/ML, he motivated and guided us every step of the way.

Most of the problem statements in SIH revolve around AI/ML technologies, as they represent the future of innovation.

In the next section, I will explain what we built, how it works, and the tools we used to develop the prototype. We named our software prototype SIR—short for Smart Image Recognition. Designed for desktop computers, SIR not only identifies objects in an image but also provides detailed information about them. The most impressive feature? It works entirely offline, ensuring seamless performance without internet dependency.

For example, when an image of a simple water bottle placed on a table is provided to the software, and the question "What is the object on the table?" is asked, the software accurately identifies it as a bottle. If the label or shape is recognized, it can also determine the brand or company associated with the bottle.

To evaluate the software's accuracy, judges conducted this live test. When an image of a Bisleri bottle was given, our system swiftly recognized it. As an additional test, a question unrelated to the image was asked: "Where is the Bisleri Headquarters located?" The software promptly responded with "Mumbai, Maharashtra." Note that no internet connection was used to get this information.

The magic lies in the AI model itself. Our application is built primarily in Python, leveraging the power of PyTorch and Transformers to integrate LLaVA—a pretrained, advanced model for image recognition and response generation.

With over 7 billion parameters, this model delivers richer contextual understanding, enhanced reasoning, and greater accuracy in tasks. The model holds comprehensive data on objects along with detailed relevant information, enabling the AI chatbot to deliver precise identification and contextual insights.

Moreover, our application allows for training and fine-tuning the model with custom datasets, ensuring adaptability to specific requirements.

In addition to these core features, we have incorporated multilingual support, batch processing, a model manager, speech recognition, and even live image and video imports. Perhaps the most powerful addition is our extension workflows, which enable further enhancements such as geo-tagging, OCR, and seamless integration of automated alert systems.

Every feature of our software was tested live by the judges in one-on-one interactions, where the whole team provided detailed explanations. As the lead, I guided the entire feature flow during the evaluations. Beyond just testing, the judges challenged us further by asking us to implement new features on the spot, ensuring that the software was genuinely developed by our team.

The nonstop 36-hour hackathon was intense, both mentally and physically exhausting. However, our strong team spirit and strategic planning helped us navigate through each round smoothly. With two rounds in total, we successfully managed to win both. Welingkar Institute provided excellent support, efficiently managing everything from accommodations and meals to the overall hackathon experience.

Winning the national-level hackathon came with a ₹1 lakh prize, which was certainly rewarding. But beyond the monetary benefit, the real victory lay in the recognition it brought. As I've heard from many, such achievements attract significant attention and credibility in the tech space. However, what truly mattered was the journey itself—traveling from east to west, collaborating and sharing insights, and learning invaluable lessons. That experience is what stays with us.

Our university showed incredible generosity by rewarding us with an additional ₹1.5 lakh for winning the hackathon. We are deeply grateful to our prestigious institution for recognizing our hard work and dedication. This was our first time participating, and our first time winning. We approached the challenge with meticulous preparation, strictly following all SIH guidelines, thoroughly analyzing the problem statement, with proper planning and execution with a well-developed prototype. Teamwork played a crucial role in our success, motivating and supporting each team member was essential in overcoming challenges.

CONCLUSION

While not everyone on our team had a background in coding, each member contributed in their own way, and their efforts played a vital role in our journey. I always encourage my friends to learn new skills and participate in events like this. Even when they feel less confident, I remind them that failure is just a stepping-stone toward success and nothing to be afraid of.

Our team went on to participate in several smaller hackathons after this, even securing victories in some of them. We aspire to participate in more tech events in the future and advance our careers.`,

    title: "React Fatigue is Real. Will Svelte Take Over?",

    content: `After a decade of fast-moving change, front-end developers are tired of framework churn and oversized bundles. Svelte promises simplicity and speed, but is it enough to topple React's ecosystem?

There's a quiet weariness among many front-end engineers. React once felt like a relief from fragile jQuery code: a clear mental model, a component system, and a pattern for building large apps. Over time, however, that clarity has blurred. Tooling multiplied, state-management debates dragged on, and projects that should be small swelled into heavy, hard-to-reason-about beasts. That feeling often described as "React fatigue", has helped Svelte gain attention. But what's really changing, and what should teams actually care about?

Why Developers Feel Worn Out?

React's strengths, flexibility and a huge ecosystem are also its burden. Teams must select routers, styling solutions, testing stacks, and a state strategy; each choice forks the project in subtle ways. New build tools, compiler tweaks, and hydration strategies appear every year. For developers who hop between codebases or ship single-purpose apps, this makes the cost of starting and maintaining projects feel high.

There's also cognitive overhead. Modern React apps rely on concepts that demand discipline: memorization, effect dependencies, context boundaries, and sometimes elaborate performance tricks. Those are reasonable for very large apps, but they add friction to smaller efforts. When the bill for mental effort keeps rising, people look for something leaner.

What Svelte Offers?

Svelte takes a different route. It shifts work from runtime to compile-time. Instead of shipping a framework that runs in the browser, Svelte converts your components to small, imperative JavaScript during the build. The result is usually smaller bundles and fewer runtime abstractions to understand.

Syntax-wise, Svelte feels familiar but lighter. Reactive assignments, top-level stores, and straightforward bindings reduce ceremony. For many developers, that translates to faster iteration and fewer surprises when debugging. And because Svelte ships less runtime, initial page loads can also be quicker, an obvious win for user experience.

But Svelte Is Not Magic!

Simplicity on the surface doesn't erase the hard parts of building software. Large teams still face coordination, testing, accessibility, and architecture concerns. State and side effects don't disappear. They simply look different.

Also, Svelte's ecosystem, while growing, is smaller than React's. When you need a niche library or a battle-tested enterprise solution, React's size often helps.

Ecosystem And Inertia Matter More Than You Think

One reason React won and why it won't vanish overnight is the mass of existing apps, libraries, developer knowledge, and corporate investment. Companies with large codebases have a high cost to switching. Hiring and onboarding also favor familiar stacks. Svelte has momentum, but converting decades of front-end code is neither cheap nor risk-free.

When Svelte Makes Sense?

Pick Svelte when you want faster time-to-first-render, smaller bundles, or a simpler mental model for small-to-medium projects. It's a solid choice for personal projects, MVPs, marketing sites, and teams that value developer ergonomics. For greenfield web apps where performance on low-end devices matters, Svelte is worth a close look.

Where React Still Wins…

If your project relies on a broad set of third-party libraries, or you operate at the scale where tooling and process are your core investment, React remains compelling. Large enterprises benefit from React's mature tooling, diverse staffing pool, and numerous integration points.

A Pragmatic Middle Path

The future will likely be plural. Svelte won't "take over" React entirely, and React won't go away. What's more realistic is that teams pick the right tool for the job. Frameworks will continue to borrow ideas from one another—compile-time tricks, islands architecture, server components—so the user ultimately wins.

React fatigue is a symptom, not a single failure. It reflects the growing pains of an ecosystem that moved fast and got large. Svelte answers many complaints with clearer, smaller outputs and a gentler developer surface. If you're tired of chasing the latest patterns or need a snappy, maintainable front end on a modest budget, give Svelte a trial. If you run at enterprise scale with deep React investments, weigh the migration cost carefully. Either way, the web is richer when teams have better choices and a little fatigue can push the industry toward cleaner, faster tools.`
